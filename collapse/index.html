This is a controversial technology and is not fully understood. The Ministry of Earth Sciences has launched a massive experiment in Maharashtra to understand the business of cloud seeding. NDTV flew in the special small plane assessing the science of creating artificial rain. Till date, this year's monsoon has been below par for the entire country.</p>
